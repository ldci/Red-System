# PROGRAMMING WITH RED and RED/SYSTEM
## [Red Language Home](https://www.red-lang.org)

Red language is a full-stack language from low to high level applications.
These are just some notes about my tests with Red and  Red/S, and I hope they will be useful to other members of the Red community. The sample code is free and without guarantees.

* **/Fonts**: system fonts tests and Red reactive programming.
* **/Looping**: simple loop tests for beginners.
* **/Map**: map! and hash! tests (including a morse code generator).
* **/Maths**: some mathematical functions.
* **/Tests**: some code sample for Red and Red/system.
* **/Threads**: concurrent tasking with and without timer events.
* **/Unicode**: support for reading and generating unicode symbols.
* **/Voices**: text to speech (macOS only).
* **/Words_counter**: different approaches for counting words in text.
