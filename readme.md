# PROGRAMMING WITH RED and RED/SYSTEM
Red language is a full-stack language from low to high level applications.
These are just some notes about my tests with Red/S and I hope they will be useful to other members of the Red community. The sample code is free and without guarantees.

* **/Tests**: some code sample for Red and Red/system.
* **/Unicode**: support for reading and generating unicode symbols.
* **/Words_counter**: different approaches for counting words in text.
